## Overview

Effort is a powerful tool that enables a convenient way to create automated tests for Entity Framework based applications. 

It is basically an ADO.NET provider that executes all the data operations on a lightweight in-process main memory database instead of a traditional external database. It also provides some intuitive helper methods that make this provider really easy to use with existing ObjectContext or DbContext classes. A simple addition to existing code might be enough to create data-driven tests that can run without the external database's presence.
